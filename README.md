## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing Indian Premier League (IPL) data from the last three years (2021, 2022, and 2023) to extract actionable insights for cricket fans, analysts, and teams.

-- Identifying top-performing players in batting and bowling based on runs, strike rates, wickets, and economy.
-- Highlighting team strategies and success rates, including winning percentages and chasing performance.
-- Analyzing season-wise and player-specific trends, such as boundary percentages and dot ball effectiveness.
-- Providing accurate, data-driven answers to questions that resonate with the IPL audience.
